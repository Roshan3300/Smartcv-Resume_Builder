SmartCV 🧠📄

A resume builder I made because editing resumes in Word / Google Docs is annoying.

You enter your details, see the resume update live, and download it.
Simple, fast, and no unnecessary stuff.

What you can do

Fill in your personal & professional details

See changes instantly in the resume preview

Download your resume when it’s ready

Use a clean layout that actually looks professional

Why this exists

I wanted a real project, not another todo app

To practice frontend + UI logic

To build something I’d actually use myself

Built using

Next.js

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS
